## Running the Project Locally

⚠️Note: The main branch is for testing and uses an ICRC ledger to deploy a dummy token for local testing. The mainnet branch uses the 3rd party ckUSDT ledger with id ```cngnf-vqaaa-aaaar-qag4q-cai``` on the mainnet.

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DannyVRSE/CLM
   cd CLM
   ```

2. **Install npm packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   On the project root folder:
   - Make deploy script executable: `chmod +x local_deploy.sh`
   - This script will deploy a dummy ICRC1 token locally to be used for transactions
   - Each new user is allocated some tokens

## Examples

### Escrow Payment Flow

- Buyer and supplier sign vendor agreement with on-delivery payment terms
- Buyer locks token in escrow account
- Supplier issues delivery note
- If the supplier fails to issue a delivery note, the tokens are returned to the buyer's wallet

### Invoice-Backed Loans

- Supplier issues a delivery note and buyer confirms it
- Supplier issues invoice
- Supplier draws credit against pending invoice
- Supplier is given 80% of the invoice value up-front
- When buyer pays the invoice, the supplier gets the 20% remaining value less 3% service charge

## Areas of Improvement

- User KYC and verification to add trust between contracting parties
- Credit score and limits, to ensure the creditworthiness of users
- A dispute resolution system for contracts has to be implemented. This will ensure a fair, non-partisan handling of contract disputes
